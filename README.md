A script that interacts with the API of [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee). Should be included on your site to track data.

## üöÄ Installation

We recommend loading ackee-tracker from your Ackee instance. This ensures that the script is always in sync with your installation. The script is served as `tracker.js` or as [a name of your choice](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee/blob/master/docs/Options.md#tracker).

```html
<script async src="https://example.com/tracker.js" data-ackee-server="https://example.com" data-ackee-domain-id="hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0"></script>
```

It's also possible to install ackee-tracker as a module via [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

```sh
npm install ackee-tracker
```

```sh
yarn add ackee-tracker
```

## ü§ó Usage

- [Automatically](#automatically) - Via script tag
- [Manually](#manually) - Via script tag and code
- [Programmatic](#programmatic) - Via module

### Automatically

The easiest way to send data to your Ackee server is by including the script along with the required attributes. Ackee will now track each page visit automatically.

This approach is perfect for static sites. It tracks a visit whenever a user visits the site or navigates to a new page. Websites with client-side routing however should consider to use any of the other approaches as this one would only track the initial page.

```html
<script async src="dist/ackee-tracker.min.js" data-ackee-server="https://example.com" data-ackee-domain-id="hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0"></script>
```

It's also possible to customize Ackee using the `data-ackee-opts` attribute.

```html
<script async src="dist/ackee-tracker.min.js" data-ackee-server="https://example.com" data-ackee-domain-id="hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0" data-ackee-opts='{ "ignoreLocalhost": true }'></script>
```

### Manually

Include the JS-file at the end of your `body` and start tracking page visits by calling `create` manually.

This approach is perfect for sites without a build system. It gives you more control than the automatic solution and allows you to use ackee-tracker without a package manager or JS bundler.

```html
<script src="dist/ackee-tracker.min.js"></script>

<script>
	ackeeTracker.create({
		server: 'https://example.com',
		domainId: 'hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0'
	}).record()
</script>
```

### Programmatic

Use ackee-tracker as a module and start tracking page visits by calling `create`.

This approach is perfect if your site uses client-side routing or changes content without reloading the site. It allows you to call Ackee whenever you need.

Example:

```js
const ackeeTracker = require('ackee-tracker')
```

```js
import * as ackeeTracker from 'ackee-tracker'

ackeeTracker.create({
	server: 'https://example.com',
	domainId: 'hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0'
}).record()
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è API

### .detect()

Looks for an element with Ackee attributes, creates an instance and starts tracking.

The function fails silently when it can't find a suitable element.

Example:

```html
<div hidden data-ackee-server="https://example.com" data-ackee-domain-id="hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0"></div>
```

```js
ackeeTracker.detect()
```

### .create(server, opts)

Creates a new ackee-tracker instance.

Be sure to assign your instance to a variable. Tracking a visit by creating a new record is only possible with an instance.

Examples:

```js
const instance = ackeeTracker.create({
	server: 'https://example.com',
	domainId: 'hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0'
})
```

```js
const instance = ackeeTracker.create({
	server: 'https://example.com',
	domainId: 'hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0'
}, {
	ignoreLocalhost: true,
	detailed: false
})
```

Parameters:

- `server` `{Object}` An object that contains details about your [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee) installation. The `server` property must not end with a slash.
- `opts` `{?Object}` An object of [options](#-options).

Returns:

- `{Object}` The created instance.

### .attributes()

Gathers and returns all platform-, screen- and user-related information.

Examples:

```js
const attributes = ackeeTracker.attributes()
```

```js
const attributes = ackeeTracker.attributes(true)
```

Parameters:

- `detailed` `{Boolean}` Include personal data.

Returns:

- `{Object}` User-related information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instance API

Each ackeeTracker instance is an object with functions you can use to track your visitor.

### .record(attributes)

Creates a new record on the server and updates the record constantly to track the duration of the visit. The update of old records will be canceled when you call this function once again.

Examples:

```js
instance.record()
```

```js
instance.record({
	siteLocation: window.location.href,
	siteReferrer: document.referrer
})
```

```js
const { stop } = instance.record()

// Manually stop updating the visit duration. The returned function should be used in
// single-page applications. Call the function when the user navigates to a new page
// before creating a new record.
stop()
```

Parameters:

- `attributes` `{?Object}` Attributes that should be transferred to the server. Will be `ackeeTracker.attributes()` unless specified otherwise.

Returns:

- `{Object}` Object with a `stop` function. Call the returned function to stop updating the visit duration of the created record.

## üîß Options

The option-object can include the following properties:

```js
{
	/*
	 * Enable or disable tracking when on localhost.
	 */
	ignoreLocalhost: true,
	/*
	 * Enable or disable tracking of personal data.
	 * We recommend to ask the user for permission before turning this option on.
	 */
	detailed: false
}
```
